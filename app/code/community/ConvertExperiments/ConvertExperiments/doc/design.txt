 ConvertExperiments ConvertExperiments allows for an easy way to add necessary Convert.com
 Javascript scripts and variables to pages of your Magento web store.

 System Configuration:
 The System Config is store scope specific so that you can enable the module on
 one store of a multi-store Magento setup.

 All that needs to be configured are your unique account identifier which will
 look something like 1001234_1001234, and your custom product attributes. The
 first two attributes are text attributes only,and the last two attributes are
 numeric attributes only. The value of the attribute will be cut off at 50
 characters.

 If the module is disabled, nothing will output on the frontend of your website.

 The Sitewide Header Javascript is placed directly below the opening <body> tag,
 and before the Google Analytics script. The custom defined REED Javascript
 variables are placed above the sitewide Javascript code, and are encapsulated
 in the same script tag. Custom attribute variables defined in the system config
 will only appear on product pages that have a value defined for that attribute.

 If an admin user selects two of the same attribute, the configuration will not
 be saved, and an error will be thrown telling the user to select unique
 attributes for each custom value. All four attributes are not required, but it
 is required to select unique attributes for each custom variable.

 If you use the Age (days) custom number attribute, a value will appear inside
 that variable on product pages that have the 'news_from_date' field defined on
 the product level for that store. The module takes the current date and
 subtracts the value given in 'news_from_date' to come up with an integer value.
 This is represented in the number of days the product has been new for.
